The NMEA0183 log srtreamer is a plugin for a SignalK server. It reads a log file containing NMEA messages and sends then to the SignalK server. It's main feature is its ability of the plugin to stream data at a controlled speed. For this it uses time information from certain messages (CGA, GLL, RMC, ZDA) in the log. The NMEA0183 log srtreamer can be used to relive a sailing trip, to configure instrument displays or to develop plugins using real data.
